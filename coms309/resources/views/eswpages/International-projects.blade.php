<ul>
    <li>
		<u>Solar Lighting</u>: The ISU ESW team and Kansas State University's Engineers Without Borders chapter went to India to assess the potential use of solar lights to create paths in villages.
		Solar lighting is crucial for these communities because they are off of the electrical grid. There are several villages in the area that are connected by paths.
		currently villagers cannot go on the paths at night safely because of a lack of portable lighting to bring with them. The light will be solar powered, using LED lights.
